        <h1>Odin Recipe: Veggies Base</h1>
        <p>This one is a cheat because this doesn't need to be cooked. Grocery stores have plenty of lettuce mixes to use or feel free to cook veggie base for your meal.
            In my opinion, a cooler mix base would be better for the hot pot but collard greens work wonders for it! </p>

            <h2>What ingredients are needed?</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Lettuce mix or base of your choice</li>
                <li>Spinach (raw or in can)</li>
               
              
              
               
                
            </ul>
            <h3> Cooking steps</h3>
                <ol>1) Boil or keep it raw lol</ol>
                <0l>2) When boiling spinach or cabbage, i like to mix in cajun spices that work with the hot pot!</0l>

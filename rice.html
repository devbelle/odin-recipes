        <h1>Odin Recipe: Base for the dish</h1>
        <p> Another base to add to the hot pot. The cool thing with rice is that it can be added to the broth after being cooked for a more soup like dish or keep it dry to place over it.
          Rice is not a hard dish to cook; really just depends on teh texture you will personally wish to have.

        <h1>Odin Recipe: Devin's New Hot Pot Recipe</h1>
        <p> This is by no means a real hot-pot recipe to preface. The joy of cooking comes out through experimentation of ingredients and flavors we like. 
            This is one personal recipe that I came up with over trying to learn new coding skillz. Hopefully you will enjoy this as well!</p>

            <h2>What ingredients are needed?</h2>
            <p>Ingredients are simple, this recipe is more of a budget one; feel free to add extra ingredients where you see fit. The taste I was going for centered around sweet and sour so just be mindful of what can compliment the fruity taste of teh sangria with the sour soy sauce</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Crab meat</li>
                <li>Shrimp</li>

                <li>Sangria wine</li>
                <li>Spice of choice</li>
            </ul>
